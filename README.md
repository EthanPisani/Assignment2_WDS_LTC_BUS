## Lab 2: Data Visualization, Exploration, and a Simple ANN with PyTorch
### Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to perform data visualization, data exploration, and build a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch. We will work with a housing prices dataset to understand its structure, visualize relationships, and ultimately predict house prices using an ANN.
Objectives

   - Data Visualization and Exploration
       - Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize relationships and distributions within the dataset.
       - Explore and preprocess data, including encoding categorical variables.

   - Building an ANN
       - Create an ANN model in PyTorch using both categorical and numerical inputs.
       - Train the model to predict house prices based on various features
    
### Assignment 2: JSON to CSV Conversion and Data Visualization
## Objective

This assignment focuses on processing JSON data related to transportation systems, converting it into a structured format, and visualizing key insights using Python libraries. The tasks include:

   - Data Parsing: Reading and understanding JSON transportation data.
   - Data Transformation: Converting JSON data into CSV format for better accessibility.
   - Data Analysis & Visualization: Creating visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
